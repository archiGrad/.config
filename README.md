## platofrmIO

on ubuntu i have had the problem that microcontrollers would not connect. 
de devide would be recognised as a usb devide, but would immediatly disconnect. this caused platformio to throw an error because it could not find the device

when typing in `sudo dmesg | grep ttyUSB` it would return that the microcontroller immedaitly was disconnected.
```shell
[ 1501.372532] usb 1-2: ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB0
[ 1497.039622] ch341-uart ttyUSB0: ch341-uart converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0

```
what fixed this error was executing: 

```shell
sudo apt remove brltty
```



## make beuatifulkk pdf's with pdflatex and mupdf


![screenshot](./pdflatex_mupdf.png)


to create a nice latex workenvironment, you can use the following alias in your .bashrc file.
it will compile the latex file and open it in mupdf but everytime you save the file, the pdf will be updated.

```shell
 alias compilepdf='pdflatex assignment.tex && pkill -HUP mupdf'

```
